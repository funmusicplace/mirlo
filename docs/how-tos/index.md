# How To Guides

Our volunteers at Mirlo will make all attempts at keeping this documentation up to date, but it's possible that some things are out of date, not yet implemented, or just not added to the documentation yet.

If there's anything you notice that is out of date, please e-mail us at hi@mirlo.space, post something in our discord, or consider fixing it in the documentation.
