To help out with translation, please read this post.

At Mirlo we use Transifex to manage our translations.

## How to get started

Please DM us on discord **with your email and the language you want to help translate**, or send us an email at hi@mirlo.space. We will get you set up with the project on Transifex : you will be assigned to your language, for which you'll be able to add translation strings.

> Note: due to a limitation in Transifex, some strings that aren't used anymore still show up. As best as we can we've tagged them as `unused`. You can exclude them from results that way. It's possible that we can delete these strings programmatically, there's a ticket to


## How to translate Mirlo using Transifex

First off, you'll find general directions for Mirlo's tone and vocabulary in this document: [MIRLO - Words we choose and why](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/nbohzknMYqYX-Lrxx0xrayedV5AG45AyU48+8QUtlN0/embed/)

* Try to understand where the string will appear on Mirlo's website.
The "key" of each string will give you some insight, don't hesitate to look up Comments or write a new one for this string if you lack good context. Transifex allows your edits to appear Live immediately after you save them, so you can see how what you just wrote integrates with the whole. Keep Mirlo open in another tab and check back and forth regularly :)
* Keep a consistent tone, use the same words for the same situations, and do your best to be faithful to what was originally written.
Transifex uses a Glossary (bottom right window while translating, second tab from the right) populated by other translators which puts dotted lines under regularly used words and expressions: use it to your advantage.
* If you're unsure on how to translate a word or expression, try looking up at what other similar platforms did for your language (Bandcamp, Soundcloud...).
[Linguee](https://www.linguee.com/) is also a good tool to see how such or such word is used, with real-world examples of translations. Finally, ask around from people who work in the music industry to know which words they use.

If you're still a bit lost, need help in any way or simply want to share your progress, feel free to chime in [on our discord](https://discord.com/channels/1070731899317796974/1245361375396626432) ! Note that you'll need the Translator role to view the translation section where most of this talk is kept.


## How this works

In our code we store a JSON file that contains "keys" that point to English strings. Eg.

```
{
...
"login": "Log in"
...
}
```

Developers add new strings to this file, with the default English language string. They will then use the key in the code itself:

```
<i>{t('login')}</i>
```

Will show: 

_Log in_

Then they will upload the JSON file to Transifex (see the README for instructions on how to do this).

At that point the translations become available for translators to translate in Transifex.

If you want to discuss or edit English language strings with that please edit the JSON file in the repo directly!
