# For artists

An artist's profile page is incredibly flexible.

## Have aliases, several bands or unrelated projects?

From a single user account login, you can generate as many
artist pages as you need or want.

## Have a lot of music to upload?

You're prolific! We get it. Or you're a label! Batch upload an
album in one click just drag and drop the content of your album
folder and you're good to go! The upload process is quick and
painless to make it easy for you to upload your catalogue.

## Embed across the web.

Need your work to appear somewhere else than on Mirlo?

Embed your tracks and albums on your own website or anywhere
else.

## Customize your page.

Want control over what your page looks like?

Style your page! Mirlo's default theme is designed to work well
even without adding any visual should you want to keep things
minimalistic, but feel free to personalize your page by adding
custom backgrounds and changing the default colors.

## Email lists

Have a community of supporters you want to stay in touch with?

Let your community know where you are on the internet. Add links to social media and an email address to let people contact you.

Keep your community engaged through blogposts that appear
directly on your artist page, and are RSS feed compatible. Blog
posts can be made public or sent to specific supporter tiers.
You can embed music hosted on Mirlo directly in your blog posts.

Don't want to manage another mailing list? Us neither. You can
migrate your current supporters' emails to Mirlo and do
everything from one platform.

## Monthly support

Want to have a predictable source of income?

Setup subscriptions so people can support your work, add
multiple tiers for premium exclusive contents, or just keep it
light and easy with a simple newsletter that your listeners can
subscribe to for free even if they don't have a Mirlo account.

Want your users to automatically get every new album you release? You can do that too.

## International payments

Need to interact with an international audience?

We can support artists from 46 countries around the world. If
you're one of these countries you can sell to people anywhere in
the world.

## Download codes

Want to share your music with press or close family and friends?

Use download codes to share your music for free with press or
your proud family members and friends. You can generate an
unlimited set of codes for download of your music. Distribute it
with your merch or send it to your press contacts.

## Flexible pricing.

You decide how much it costs.

Artists get to choose how much of each sale goes to us. So if
you want 10% of your album sale to go Mirlo, and you sell it for
$10, we will get $1. If, instead, you need 100% of the sale, you
get to keep it! Our payment processor (Stripe) takes a 2.9% +
30c cut. We trust artists to know how much of their sales they
can afford to give to us.

## Catalog pricing.

You can set a price on your full catalog, so that a supporter can pay one price and get your entire current catalogue in one go.

## Merch

You can sell Merch using Mirlo. Merch shows up on your profile page,
you can set flexible prices, track how much quantity you have remaining,
set different types and categories, set custom shipping costs, etc.
