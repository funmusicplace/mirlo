    "questions.howDoPayoutsWork.question": "How do payouts work?",
    "questions.howDoPayoutsWork.answer": "We use Stripe to process payments.

    "questions.howAreYouStructured.answer": "Mirlo is currently a collective of people interested in building a worker-coop accountable to a community that uses its product.
