So if a musician sells an album on for $10, Mirlo will earn 70 cents. <i>Then</i>, our payment processor Stripe, will take a cut, which is 2.9% + 30c (so much larger on small transactions).</p><p>Want to know more about how we calculated our take rate? Check out <takeRate>our blog post explaining how we got there</takeRate>.</p> <p>While we hope to be fully funded by transactions on Mirlo, in the mean time we're dependent on direct monthly financial contributions. <giveDirectly>Support Mirlo with a monthly contribution</giveDirectly>.</p>",
