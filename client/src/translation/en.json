    "pricingText": "<p>Artists get to decide how much of their sale goes to Mirlo. They do this by setting a percentage on sales. So if an artist sells an album on for $10, they will decide whether Mirlo gets 70 cents, $1, or nothing. This lets artists decide how much of their money they need for themselves. By default, Mirlo charges 10% on each sale. <i>Then</i>, our payment processor Stripe, will take a cut of 2.9% + 30c (proportionally <proportionally>this is larger on small transactions</proportionally>).</p><p>Want to know more about our thought process? Check out <takeRate>our blog post explaining how we got there</takeRate>.</p> <p>As we develop our project and come to terms with the costs of running it, we will adjust these numbers and explore new ways of financing Mirlo.</p>",
