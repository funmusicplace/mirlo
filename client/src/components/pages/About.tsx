          The music industry does not work for artists or listeners and needs a

        <p>
          Mirlo hosts a community of artists, listeners, organizers, and coders
          who are daring to do just that: taking lessons learned from working in
          the solidarity economy and applying them to our platform.

          We are building an online audio distribution and patronage platform

          modular, and standards based.

        <p>
          The idea of Mirlo grew out of conversations that began in late 2022 as
          a handful of musicians, technologists, and mutual aid organizers began
          to find each other and reflect on their experiences working with two
          ongoing music cooperative initiatives at the time,{" "}
          <a href="https://ampled.com/">Ampled</a> and{" "}
          <a href="https://resonate.coop/">Resonate</a>. Through those
          conversations, we began to develop a shared analysis of today’s
          precarious music industry and invited others to join us in the
          conversations we published online at{" "}
          <a href="https://funmusic.place">Fun Music Place</a>. We also started
          to{" "}
          <a href="https://funmusic.place/blog/the-spotify-ai-blues/">
            dream together
          </a>{" "}
          about what alternatives that foregrounded mutual aid and the value of
          musical creativity might actually look like. Two of the group members,
          LLK and Si, wrote code for an initial software product.
        </p>
        <p>
          As these conversations unfolded, Bandcamp was sold again, firing half
          of their employees in the process. We realized the heightened need for
          viable alternatives to the corporate giants. Ultimately, three of us
          who were based in the United States{" "}
          <a href="https://mirlo.space/team/posts/10/"> formed an LLC</a> and
          became the <a href="#team">official co-founders and worker-owners</a>{" "}
          , with other contributors continuing to offer support internationally.
          We joined the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.usworker.coop/en/">
            US Federation of Worker Cooperatives
          </a>{" "}

          Behind the platform Our member stewards have experience working both
          within Resonate and Ampled, other co-ops across several industries,
          and complex high-traffic web platforms. We envision this platform as a
          tool to support musicians in cultivating direct and reciprocal
          relationships and resources to sustain one another’s creative
          practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Mirlo is legally incorporated as an entity recognized by the
          United States of America, our work is hugely dependent on a network of
          people who have helped us with get to where we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're immensely grateful to everyone who is supporting us through
          labor or financial contributions to get us here.

        <h3>Our operating agreement</h3>

            We're delighted to publicly share{" "}

              our operating agreement
            </a>
            . The company is managed by its{" "}

          </p>
          <p>
            Decisions on behalf of the company are made by consent of member
            stewards, meaning that no member steward objects to the decision
            taken. Feel free to{" "}

            for All.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stewards are the people who, through their contributions, help move
            Mirlo forward; we want to ensure that anyone doing this work has an
            opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the decisions that impact
            how the platform runs itself. When someone joins Mirlo as a Steward,
            they can also become legal owners; however, that is not a
            requirement. Either way, Stewards are invited to the regular member
            meetings and consent to decisions that impact the overall ecosystem
            alongside legal members. To read more about how member stewards slot
            operate within Mirlo, read our{" "}

          <p>
            Work at Mirlo is done in circles, defined teams that can include
            both stewards and organizer volunteers. Those circles can make
            decisions within their delegated domain by consent, without having
            to run it by the full members' circle.{" "}

        <p>
          We need your help to make it a reality. To pull it off we need money
          to pay ourselves for our time as well as for all the material costs of
          running a business at this scale. In May, we{" "}

            ran a successful kickstarter
          </a>{" "}
          which gave us some runway for the rest of this year. It would cover
          our basic costs including legal fees, server fees, travel fees, etc.
          Our estimated budget can be viewed{" "}
          <a href="link to spreadsheet">here</a>.

        <p>
          In the meantime, we are seeking ongoing financial support on Mirlo
          itself. Please pitch in on{" "}

        <p>
          Mirlo aims to bring about a vibrant ecosystem that values creative
          work and ensures that artists don't have to sacrifice basic needs in
          order to follow their inspiration. We believe that in order to bring
          that world about, we need tools to help connect one another through
          music, grounded in the material challenges of musicians struggling
          through the drudgery of isolation and hyperindividualism---especially
          those who come from working-class backgrounds and people of the global
          majority, who are disproportionately impacted by today’s dominant
          systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given how much music is mediated through the internet, musicians need
          to have a say in how those tools are built and maintained. We believe
          that an approach that prioritizes long-term sustainability, emphasizes
          transparency, practices informed consent, and welcomes serendipity
          through open standards will offer a path towards these goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also recognize that some of these ideals will have to be negotiated
          through intense contradictions as they come into conflict with the
          ruins of the market-driven music industry we're living in today. To
          work through those contradictions, we prioritize building trust,
          sharing joy, and fostering resilient relationships to find creative
          pathways towards this vision together.

                  Mirlo allows for direct and ongoing support of artists. It’s
                  different from other crowdfunding platforms because it:

                Ampled, and we’re in touch with a couple of other projects that
                are doing very similar things like jam.coop, faircamp, ampwall,
                patrontape, tone.audio, and some others. We’re hoping to
                continue talking to these folks and build towards
                standardization of resources and tech APIs so that our services

                  For upload we support lossless file formats (flac, wav). Upon
                  request we convert files across formats to be available to
                  purchasers, as well as converting them to HLS and a couple of
                  mp3 bitrates. We store the original file you upload without
                  changing it.

                <p>
                  When someone <strong>streams</strong> an album on our site,
                  they are listening to a 320k stream, using the libmp3lame
                  codec. For streaming, fmmpeg mixes channels down to 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When someone <strong>downloads</strong> a digital album, they
                  can choose what format to download. Downloading WAV and FLAC
                  files will be lossless, and will preserver multichannel audio.
                  MP3 and OPUS files will not support multichannel audio.

                  There’s only one account type on Mirlo! Any user can make an
                  artist to upload music to at any point. To do so, click on the
                  top right menu and click on “Manage Artist”, this will let you
                  add new artists.

                <p>
                  You can add support tiers by going to your artist's profile,
                  clicking “edit page” (or navigating to it through the top
                  right dropdown menu), and then switching to the “Support
                  tiers” tab. There's an “+ add tier” button that will let you
                  create a support tier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To enable this you'll need to sign up with our payment
