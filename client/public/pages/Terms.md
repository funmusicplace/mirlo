# Terms of Use

This work is licensed under a Peer Production License, which permits reuse exclusively for non-commercial and worker-owned enterprises.

## Section 1. Welcome and Cooperative’s Objectives

Welcome to the Mirlo Terms of Use! In this document, we do our best to avoid too much legal language and make this as understandable as possible. We believe that terms of use should be fair, transparent, and easy to understand. We’ve included simple explanations like this in the document and also some cartoons. The explanations in quotes and cartoons are not part of the official legal terms.

## Section 2. Acceptance of Terms of Use

The following terms and conditions govern your use of this website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”) offered by Mirlo US LLC. (“Mirlo,” “we,” or “us”). You are agreeing to these legally binding terms and conditions (the “Terms of Use”) by signing up or otherwise using the Services, or accessing any content or material that is made available by Mirlo through the Service. You are also agreeing to our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Community Guidelines.

## Section 3. Changes to Terms of Use

Mirlo may, from time to time, make changes to the Terms of Use in consultation with the Worker-Owners and Artist-Owners of Mirlo. All changes that are made to the Terms of Use are effective immediately. Once a change is made, we will provide you with a prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. We may display a prominent notice on the Services or by sending you an email, or both. Your continued use of the Services after the changes have been made will constitute your continued acceptance of these terms and the changes. We encourage you to read any changes carefully.

## Section 4. The Mirlo Platform

Mirlo is a platform that allows community users to support their favorite music artists with monthly recurring payments.

### Section 4a. How Artist Support Works

You agree to the following by supporting an Artist: You are doing so because you want to support an artist or artist(s), not because you expect something in return.

Artists owe their supporters a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to setting good faith expectations for supporters. However, Mirlo does not guarantee that Artists deliver content or work.

When you support an artist, you will be charged on the monthly anniversary of the date of your initial support. (i.e. If you make a supporting payment on March 1 st then you will be billed again on April 1st.) If you support multiple artists, you will be charged monthly on the date that each artist was initially supported.

**Payment Processing Fees** To process payments, we use Stripe Connect, which charges $0.30 + 2.9% per successful card charge. We take processing payments to Artists seriously - and using Stripe allows us to do this in a secure, safe, and compliant way.

Mirlo shall be entitled to a share of the revenue received from Transactions (the “Revenue Share”), which shall be calculated on your gross revenue from Transactions, not including any Transactions for which you or we provide a refund, in accordance with the rate schedule set forth at[ ](https://bandcamp.com/pricing)TKTK. You shall be solely responsible and liable for, and Mirlo shall have no responsibility or liability for, any Stripe fees (except for fees charged on Mirlo’s Stripe account), credit card transaction fees (together, “Fees”), bad debts (such as credit card returns or fraud), disputed payments, and refunds, except as provided in this Agreement.

### Section 4b. An Artist’s Intellectual Property

**Artist Intellectual Property** Artists should only post things they have permission or a license to post. Mirlo does not own content Artists submit to us (the “Content”). Artists keep ownership of what they post on Mirlo. However, Mirlo does need certain licenses from artists in order to perform our Services. When Artists create an Artist Page, or post content, they agree to these terms:

- Artists are responsible for all of their activity in connection with the Service. For purposes of these Terms of Use, the term “Content” includes, without limitation, any videos, audio clips, written comments, information, data, text, photographs, graphics, provided, or otherwise made accessible by the Artist on or through the Service.
- By way of example, and not as a limitation, Artists shall not (and shall not permit any third party to) either (a) take any action or (b) upload, download, post, submit or otherwise distribute or facilitate distribution of any content on or through the Service, that: infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity or other right of any other person or entity or violates any law or contractual duty.
- Artists must own, control, or be authorized to distribute everything they upload. That means Artists cannot post covers, unless they have a written license or authorization from the owner of said material to upload the cover to the Service and grant us the rights in the terms below. Artist Content will not contain third-party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third-party proprietary rights, unless the Artist has permission from the rightful owner of the material, or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material (and to grant Mirlo all the license rights outlined here). Any royalties or licensing on Artist Content is the responsibility of the Artist. Artists will pay all royalties and other amounts owed to any person or entity based on the Content, or on Mirlo’s hosting of that Content.
- Artists warrant that the rights of any third-party are not being violated should Mirlo use the Content. If Mirlo or its users exploit or make use of your submission in the ways contemplated in this agreement, Artists promise that this will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including (without limitation) any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights. Artists are responsible for the stuff you post. All information submitted to the Site, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom that content originated.

Mirlo is not responsible for mistakes in your content. Mirlo will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any content.

Mirlo can use the content you’ve submitted. For the purposes of marketing, you grant to us, and others acting on our behalf, the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right to use, exercise, and commercialize the copyright, publicity, trademark, and database rights with respect to your Content.

When we use the content, we can make changes, like editing or translating it. You grant us the right to edit, modify, reformat, excerpt, delete, or translate any of your Content.

If any agreement you have entered into with any third party, including, but not limited to a PRO, music publisher, union or guild, whether by law or contract, prohibits you from granting company the right and license set forth in this Agreement and making the representations and warranties set forth in the paragraphs above, then you are prohibited from uploading your music to the Service and shall be responsible for indemnifying and holding company harmless from and against any and all claims arising from the exploitation of your music on the Service, including all court costs and legal fees.

### Section 4c. Mirlo’s Intellectual Property

You agree to respect all copyright, trademark, patent, and other legal notices, information, and restrictions contained in any content accessed through the Site or Service. You also agree not to change, translate, or otherwise create derivative works of the Service or Site.

Mirlo grants the User/Supporter a license to reproduce content from the Services for personal use only. This license covers both our own protected content and Artist-generated content on the Site. This license is worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable. If you want to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, or store any of this content for a commercial purpose, you need prior written permission from Mirlo or the relevant copyright holder. A “commercial purpose” means you intend to use, sell, license, rent, or otherwise exploit content for commercial use, in any way.

### Section 4d. Other Websites

Mirlo may contain links to other websites. (For instance, artist pages, user profiles, and comments may link to outside sites.) When you access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. We do not control or endorse those sites. Mirlo partners with other companies (such as Stripe) for payment processing. When you support an artist, you are also agreeing to the payment processor’s terms of use and service.

### Section 4e. Rights Reserved to Mirlo

Mirlo reserves these rights:

- To make changes to the Mirlo Site and Services without notice or liability.
- To decide eligibility to use Mirlo. Mirlo can cancel accounts or decline to offer our Services, especially following abuse of account privileges. Mirlo may change eligibility criteria at any time.
- To cancel any Artist support, at any time, and for any reason.
- To reject, interrupt, remove, or suspend any Artist page at any time and for any reason. Mirlo is not liable for any damages as a result of any of these actions.

### Section 4f. **Fan Personal Information – Fans.**

Please see our Privacy Policy for information on how we collect, use, share and safeguard personal information. Company requires each Artist to agree to the terms set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement. However, you acknowledge that Company has no control over Artists’ use of personal information about fans, such as your email address, country of residence and zip/postal code (“Fan Information”), and you further acknowledge and agree that Mirlo shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the Artists’ use of such Fan Information.

### Section 4g. Fan Personal Information - Artists.

In connection with certain features of the Service, including by requiring that fans provide you with their e-mail addresses and other personal information in order to access the free download option, you may collect certain types of Fan Information. You acknowledge and agree that you will not disclose, rent, or sell any Fan Information to any third party, and you will use the Fan Information only in connection with the Artist’s mailing list or a subscription to the Artist (“Artist Subscription”), in order to provide fans with general information and news about the Artist, such as upcoming shows, new Music or other Content delivered in connection with your Artist Subscription. You further agree that any e-mail or other communication sent to the Artist’s mailing list or sent in connection with the Artist Subscription will comply with e-mail marketing laws and include a mechanism by which the recipient can unsubscribe from the mailing list, along with clear instructions on how to do so (i.e. a functioning “opt-out” mechanism). You will promptly implement a recipient’s request to opt-out of receiving e-mails from you and will not send any further e-mails to such opting-out recipient.

## Section 5. Account Management

To create an account you represent that you are 1) the age of majority in your jurisdiction (usually 18), or 2) are over the age of 13 and have the express permission of a legal guardian to obtain an account and to use the Services connected with the account. Do not pretend you are someone else. You are responsible for all the activity on your account. You can browse Mirlo without registering for an account. But to create an Artist page or support an Artist page, you will need to register, choose a username, and set a password. When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate and complete. Do not impersonate anyone else or choose names that are offensive in any way deemed as such by Mirlo. If you do not follow these rules, Mirlo may cancel your account.

You are responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential. If you find out that someone has compromised your account without your permission, you should report it to hi@mirlo.space.

### Section 5b. Deleting an Account.

You can terminate your account at any time through your account settings. We may retain certain information as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes. All provisions of this agreement survive termination of an account, including our rights regarding any content you’ve already submitted to the Site. (For instance, if you’ve launched a project, deleting your account will not automatically remove the project from the Site.) You can contact us at hi@mirlo.space for additional information or to request an artist page deletion.
