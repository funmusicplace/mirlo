Please check this Cookie Policy periodically for updates.

## 1. What are Cookies?

Cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies (collectively "Cookies") are files containing small amounts of information which are stored by your browser on any Internet-enabled device – such as your computer, smart phone, or tablet – when you visit a website. Most web pages contain elements from multiple web domains so when you visit our Sites, your browser may receive Cookies from several sources.

Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies do lots of different and useful jobs, such as remembering your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences), distinguishing you from other users of the Sites, generally improving your online experience, and helping us to offer you the best product and services. We use Cookies and other technologies to ensure visitors to our Sites have the best possible experience and to provide targeted advertising.

## 2. How you can control or delete Cookies

We provide you with several ways to manage Cookies:

- You can disable first- or third-party Cookies by use of your browser settings;
- You can use opt-out tools provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA), or National Advertising Initiative (NAI).

Our performance, functionality and targeting/advertising Cookies are not strictly necessary for the Sites to work but will provide you with a better browsing experience. You can delete or block these Cookies, but if you do this, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit the Sites and some features of the Sites may not work as intended. For example, you may not be able to visit certain areas of the Sites or you may not receive personalized information when you visit our Sites.

## 3. Types of Cookies Used by Mirlo

We use different types of Cookies to run our Sites. Some or all of the Cookies identified below may be stored in your browser.

Currently Mirlo only uses session cookies, used to log you in.

Many of the Cookies placed through our Sites are session Cookies, while others are persistent Cookies, and some are “first-party” Cookies, while others are “third-party” Cookies.

- **First-party Cookies** are those set by a site that is being visited by the user at the time (e.g., Cookies placed by mirlo.space).
- **Third-party Cookies** are Cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the site being visited by the user. For example, when a user visits a site and a cookie set on that site by a third-party fires, it transfers information to the user's web browser, where it might be stored or sent back with the next request to the same server. Cookies that are sent through these third-party components are called third-party cookies and are mainly used for advertising and tracking across the web.
- **Persistent Cookies** are Cookies that remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the site that created that particular cookie.
- **Session Cookies** are Cookies that allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session Cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session Cookies are deleted.
